    <h1>Easy Fluffy Pancakes Recipe</h1>
    <p>"In 2022, researchers excavating the Shanidar Cave complex in Iraq unearthed the charred remains of some of the
        world’s oldest cooked leftovers. As Ceren Kabukcu, an archaeobotanical scientist at the University of Liverpool
        and the lead author of a paper on the discovery, says in an email, “It looked like the seeds were soaked before
        they were cooked. You can tell if it’s soaked or cracked before it’s mashed into a patty. From this, we
        suggested [the food underwent] something like a flat preparation.” The 70,000-year-old culinary treat was, in
        other words, a proto pancake."</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups (195g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon aluminum-free baking powder, important to level the tablespoon, see tips</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of fine sea or table salt, reduce to 1/4 teaspoon if sensitive to salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups (295ml) milk, dairy or non-dairy</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons (70g) unsalted butter, plus more for skillet</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract, reduce if sensitive to vanilla</li>

    <p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT PANCAKE RECIPE</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the butter: Melt the butter and set it aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Combine dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, <br>and salt.
        </li>
        <li>Combine wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, <br>and vanilla
            extract. Don’t worry if the butter solidifies a little.</li>
        <li>Mix the batter: Create a well in the center of your dry ingredients. Pour the milk mixture <br>into the well
            and gently whisk until the flour is just incorporated. A few small lumps are <br>perfectly normal. As the
            batter rests, you should see it begin to bubble. It will be thick, like <br>cake batter. If it seems too
            thick, add a splash more milk to thin it out.</li>
        <li>Preheat the skillet: Place a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. To check if it’s <br>ready, sprinkle
            a few drops of water on the surface. They should “dance” around and <br>evaporate quickly.</li>
        <li>Cook the pancakes: Brush the skillet with melted butter for crispy edges (you can skip this <br>if using a
            good nonstick pan). Scoop the batter onto the skillet using a 1/4 cup measure or <br>a large cookie scoop,
            then gently spread each pancake into a 4-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes: After 1 to 2 minutes, the edges will look dry, and bubbles will form and <br>pop on the
            surface. Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until they’re <br>lightly browned and cooked
            through. Enjoy your pancakes right away with warm syrup, <br>more butter, and berries.</li>
